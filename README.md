# Drupal-Rag-Chatbot

This project leverages the case studies available on the drupal.org website on the link https://www.drupal.org/case-studies to create a Retrieval Augmented Generation ChatBot.

You can clone the repository using the link

`git clone https://github.com/Jarvis2008/Drupal-Rag-Chatbot.git`

After Cloning the repository, create a .env file and `GROQ_API_KEY' which can be found on https://console.groq.com/keys  and after that you need to check whether docker, docker-compose is installed on the system.

If Docker Daemon is running, then you can run this command to build the RAG application and it will give you a sharable gradio app link.

`docker-compose up --build`
